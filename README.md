LeetCode Simple – DSA Difficulty Predictor

LeetCode Simple is a web-based application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that predicts a user’s DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) problem-solving level based on their LeetCode username. The application fetches user data dynamically through an API by taking the LeetCode username as input. It retrieves information about the number of problems solved in different categories such as Easy, Medium, and Hard.

After fetching the data, the system analyzes the user’s problem-solving statistics and determines their overall difficulty level. If the user has solved more Easy problems, they are categorized as an Easy solver. If they have solved a higher number of Medium-level problems, they are classified as a Medium solver. Similarly, users with a strong record of solving Hard problems are identified as Hard solvers.

The project demonstrates key frontend development concepts including API integration, DOM manipulation, and conditional logic. HTML is used to structure the webpage, CSS is applied for styling and responsiveness, and JavaScript handles data fetching and analysis.

This application provides a simple, fast, and user-friendly way to evaluate coding proficiency based on real-time data, helping users understand their DSA skill level and track their progress effectively.
